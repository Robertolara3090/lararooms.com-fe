                <p className="mt-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
                  Hereâ€™s Roberto Owner Lara rooms, young guy from Barcelona Spain, I have
                  been in London since 2015.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
                  I come from a very small town in Barcelona called Cardona with no more
                  than five thousand inhabitants where my whole family lives and I always
                  dedicated myself to the construction sector until I was 25 years old
                  until the crisis came and I decided to move to London to have new
                  experiences.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
                  My first years in London started working in restaurants, I started as a
                  kitchen porter in Oxford circus then I became a bartender in Old Street
                  and I also worked as a waiter in Indian restaurant then I started in the
                  property management sector in my spare time because one day my landlord
                  offered me advertising their rooms, then little by little I was leaving
                  the hospitality until I dedicate myself full time to the property
                  management sector.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
                  Then I started working full time for an agency where I started as a
                  maintance supervisor and at the same time also became a letting agent,
                  after 3 years I met many contacts in the property management sector and
                  learned very well to know how to handle an agency thanks to the fact
                  that I had professional and good colleagues with more than 15 years of
                  experience.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-3 text-lg text-gray-600">
                  London is a big city and full of opportunities for young people like me
                  who want to grow business or expand their professional career at the
                  same time it makes you personally strong, so I invite you to have a very
                  good experience in this amazing city full of dreams with Lara rooms.
